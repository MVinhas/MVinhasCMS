# Seamus
Seamus (that's the dog) is a simple PHP project aimed to be a blog made from scratch, using only Twig as a template engine and Bootstrap/jQuery for CSS/JS business respectively.

## Project name origin
The name was inspired after a Pink Floyd song, 'Seamus', from the album Meddle. The song itself is not that nice, but it's a nice intro for the truly masterpiece of Meddle, 'Echoes'. Haven't you heard yet? *Haha, charade you are*
