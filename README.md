mvinhas-blog is an MVC CMS blog build from scratch, only with Bootstrap as CSS/JS provider and Twig as a template engine. The primary goal has educational intentions, but it is expected to serve the final user as a simple but functional CMS blog to use for whatever purpose

## Contributing
I made this as an open project to share with others my thoughts on how a PHP blog should be done; of course, there are other ways (and probably more efficient) to achieve the same goal, and please, feel free to contribute and share your thoughts with me.
